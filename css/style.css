/*Step 1: Animate the logo with keyframes.  (Here is a keyframes reference.) It should start at a width of 25px and grow to 475px.  It should also start with an opacity of 0 and end with an opacity of 1. The animation should take 5 seconds and only happen when the page is loaded. **You can complete this step later in the process - it won’t affect the larger views.*/
@keyframes mymove {
    from {top: 0px;}
    to {top: 200px;}
}

#logo {

}

/*Step 2: Edit the body element to use the Poppins font (using Google fonts) with serif as a backup.  It should also use the image “concrete_seamless.png” as a background-image with a backup color of #f1f1f1.*/
body {
    font-family: "Poppins", serif;
    background-image: url("../images/concrete_seamless.png");
    background-color: #f1f1f1;
}

/*Step 3: Edit the css for the header tag (all instances) to use flex to match our example.*/
header {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
    align-items: center;
}

/*Step 4:Edit the css for the nav_links class to use flex to match our example. Do not modify the list items or the links - modify the nav_links class to use flex.*/
.nav_links {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: column;
}
